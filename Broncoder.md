# Introduction

Broncoder.wsf is a file that I found on my USB that I gave to my mom so she puts a movie on it for her middle school students.
When I asked her where the USB has been, she said it has been on a Windows 7 old laptop.
So I decided to analyse the file.

### Key goals of analysis:
- Understaing behavior, impact and spread strategies of the malware.
- Bit of trolling and amusement.

## Malware Summary

### Names and Variants:
Currently, **2** variants are within my knowledge:
1- Broncoder.wsf
2- photo.jpg.wsf
